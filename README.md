# Jogging Tracker

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Overview

Jogging Tracker is an API that demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and feature-rich REST APIs using modern technologies. This project showcases my expertise in backend development, system architecture, and best practices in software engineering.

## üöÄ Key Technical Achievements

### Architecture & Infrastructure
- Implemented a containerized application using Docker for consistent development and deployment
- Set up a robust development environment with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery
- Designed a scalable database schema with proper relationships and constraints
- Integrated Redis for message queuing
- Implemented Celery for handling asynchronous tasks and background jobs

### Security & Authentication
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- Created role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Secured API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization
- Implemented password hashing and secure user management

### API Design & Implementation
- Built a RESTful API following best practices and standards
- Implemented comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Created efficient ORM queries
- Integrated third-party weather API for real-time weather data
- Implemented weekly report generation with data aggregation

### Performance & Scalability
- Used Celery background tasks for heavy computations
- Optimized ORM queries for better performance
