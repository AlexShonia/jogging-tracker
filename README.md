# Jogging Tracker

API is live now: http://jog-tracker.ashonia.info

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Project Overview

Jogging Tracker is an API that demonstrates my ability to build scalable, secure, and feature-rich REST APIs using modern technologies. This project showcases my expertise in backend development, system architecture, and best practices in software engineering.

## üöÄ Key Technical Achievements

### Architecture & Infrastructure
- Implemented a containerized application using Docker for consistent development and deployment
- Set up a robust development environment with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery
- Designed a scalable database schema with proper relationships and constraints
- Integrated Redis for message queuing
- Implemented Celery for handling asynchronous tasks and background jobs

### Security & Authentication
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- Created role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types
- Secured API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization
- Implemented password hashing and secure user management

### API Design & Implementation
- Built a RESTful API following best practices and standards
- Implemented comprehensive input validation and error handling
- Created efficient ORM queries
- Integrated third-party weather API for real-time weather data
- Implemented weekly report generation with data aggregation

### Advanced Filtering System
- Implemented a powerful and flexible filtering system that supports:
  - Multiple filter types: exact match, range, negation, and OR conditions
  - Complex queries combining multiple filters
  - Filtering on all relevant fields (date, distance, time, location, etc.)
  - Support for both jogging activities and weekly reports
  - Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- Implemented extensive test coverage for all major features
- Tests for user authentication and role-based permissions
- API endpoint testing with REST framework's APIClient
- Data validation and business logic testing
- Weekly report calculation verification
- Test cases for all user roles (admin, manager, customer)

### Performance & Scalability
- Used Celery background tasks for heavy computations
- Optimized ORM queries for better performance

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jogging-tracker
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
